_Workout Tracker_

This is an app designed to allow bodybuilders and serious weight lifters to track their workouts.

This is not an app aimed at beginners. Being a beginner is great because that means you are finally taking your fitness and health seriously, but this app is not a personal trainer in your pocket. If you are a beginner and need videos showing you exercises and stuff like that, go on the app store and download one of the big workout tracker apps.

With that being said, this is what the app will allow you to track:

- Performance from workout to workout, also over a long period of time (month, cut/bulk, year, all time, etc.)
- Your current weight and bodyfat percentage, to be correlated with your performance at those stats.
- bf%, weight, the amount of tonnage, sets, reps, intensity, session activity (sets/reps ex: 8-7-5-4) or max weight you were lifting on a certain lift or muscle group

There will be a line graph (similar to stock chart) that you can sort by bf%, weight, the amount of tonnage, sets, reps, intensity or max weight you were lifting on a certain lift or muscle group. You can enter your bodyfat and weight as often as you would like, and the graph fills in linearly. So if you put 165lbs one day, then wait a month and put in 170lbs, the graph will go up linearly to get to 170 from 165 within a month. You can bring up unlimited amount of things to correlate on the line graph, similar to Google Trends where there are multiple lines crossing over each other.

There will be a pre-set rest timer once a set is done that you can pause or cancel at any time.

You will be able to edit past workouts. This editing will be similar to using a notes app instead of having to go through and hit the rep buttons etc.

You will also be able to create custom exercises. For example, if you are using a chest press machine in a certain gym and then you move to another gym you will be able to make an exercise called "X gym chest press machine" and then "Y gym chest press machine".

You will also be able to track custom muscle groups. For example, instead of "Back", you will be able to track "Lower Back", "Lats", "Upper Back", "Mid Traps", etc. When you create a lift, you will be able to assign muscle groups to it. So for example you can add "Flat Single Arm DB Bench" and assign "Triceps", "Chest" and "Front Delts" to that lift. This will make it so the volume from that lift gets added to all of those muscles' volume/tonnage etc.

You will also be able to assign how many sets per exercise adds to each muscle group. For example, 1 set of bench press could equal to 1 set for chest but only 0.5 sets for triceps since it doesn't hit triceps as much as chest.

You will also be able to save custom exercises so you only have to type them out once.

Ultimately, what this app will be is a notes app but with added features. There will be no premade exercises, only the ones that you type in, because odds are if you are a serious lifter you already know what you want to do in the gym. The exercises you type will then be saved as exercises in case you want to reuse them and not have to type them in again.

You will be able to input the weight and reps of a set with just a click of a button. No typing. Just big buttons that you tap.

You will also be able to set your split to a certain day loop. So by default it will be a 7 day loop, so every monday will be the same, every tuesday will be the same etc. But you can also set it to a 10 day loop, a 14 day loop or set an exercise to "Every 3rd day" so Monday-Thursday-Sunday-Wednesday-Saturday etc.

You will also be able to cycle different exercises every other week or every other workout for that lift. So for example if you have Monday - Overhand Pullups, you can set it to cycle to Underhand Chinups every other week. So Monday 1 = Overhand, Monday 2 = Underhand, etc.

You will also be able to make your split go more than 7 days (a week). For example, instead of doing the same training every monday, you can extend it to a 10 day split or 14 day split etc. So you could set chest and triceps to be Monday-Thursday-Sunday-Wednesday-Saturday-Monday instead of Monday-Thursday-Monday-Thursday.

You will also be able to edit a current split by removing an exercise, adding an exercise or moving an exercise to a different day.

Exercise data will always stay on your account even if you delete it from all of your splits. Analytics will be permanent.

Notes:

This is just some notes on the app's design until I move it to actual documentation or something.

When first opening the app, there will be an "Add Split" button. This will allow you to create different workout splits since most people change their splits over time to either experiment with a different split or just needing to tweak it. You will be able to name each split. When viewing statistics with the line graph, you can check off the box for each split you want to be compared on the line graph.
